vim-fish
========

This is an addon for Vim providing support for editing [fish][] scripts.

[fish]: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell

Features aplenty
----------------

* Syntax highlighting and filetype detection, of course.
* Automatic indentation based on keywords for control structures.
* Automatic folds for everything that `end` terminates in fish.
* Code formatting with `fish_indent` using the `gq` operator.
* Jumping to file in fish's function path that defines the function under the
  cursor using the `gf` command.
* Searching for definitions including sourced files using commands like `[i`.
* Keyword lookup that includes pages for fish builtins using the `K` command.
* Completions from fish using the `^X^O` command.
* Syntax checking with quickfix using the `:make` command.
* Improved `funced` experience using commands like `S` to instantly start
  typing commands in the function body.
* Mimics `funced` when manually creating new functions.
* Automatic formatting of comments.

For everything above to work you need to have fish installed in `$PATH` and
some Vim features turned on.  First, tell Vim to use the syntax and filetype
functionality, normally in your `~/.vimrc`:

```vim
syntax enable
filetype plugin indent on
```

Next, set some options for the `fish` filetype.  You can do this either by
prefixing each line with `autocmd FileType fish`, or by putting them in your
own `~/.vim/ftplugin/fish.vim` file:

```vim
" Set up :make to use fish for syntax checking.
compiler fish

" Set this to have long lines wrap inside comments.
setlocal textwidth=79

" Enable folding of block structures in fish.
setlocal foldmethod=expr
```

To make the folds more pleasant to work with you might also want to tweak
settings like `foldlevelstart` and `foldminlines`, which you could do either
globally in your `~/.vimrc` or locally as described above.

A team player
-------------

*vim-fish* ships with support for:

* Code snippets for [UltiSnips][]
* A syntax checker for [Syntastic][]
* Insertion rules for [endwise][]
* Configuration for [commentary][]
* Patterns for [matchit][]

But you don't have to install any of those to use this addon.

Teach a Vim to fishâ€¦
--------------------

Vim needs a more POSIX compatible shell than fish for certain functionality to
work, such as `:%!`, compressed help pages and many third-party addons.  If you
use fish as your login shell or launch Vim from fish, you need to set `shell`
to something else in your `~/.vimrc`, for example:

```vim
if &shell =~# 'fish$'
    set shell=sh
endif
```

Best do it somewhere at the top, before any addon code is loaded and executed.

Note that this also affects what `:sh[ell]` launches, so if you care about that
you might want to set it to your second best shell instead.  If you use Vim in
the terminal you could also train yourself to use `:st[op]` or CTRL-Z instead
and then `fg` in fish to get back to Vim.
